	<h2>Open data</h2>

	<p>Museums provide their users access to a wealth of cultural heritage 
	objects either by exhibiting them, or by presenting them via digital 
	channels. Many of these cultural objects, their digital copies and parts of 
	the accrued metadata are subject to concerns such as copyright and 
	intellectual property rights, confidentiality, security and privacy. To 
	protect the concerns related to cultural heritage objects, museums will 
	implement a balanced policy governing access to these cultural 
	resources.</p>

	<p>Flemish Art Collection complements these policies with a series of open 
	access and open data initiatives to enhance digital access to knowledge 
	about the cultural heritage collections preserved by the museums.</p>
